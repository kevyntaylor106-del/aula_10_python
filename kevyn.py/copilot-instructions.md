# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

This project currently contains a single file: `python_aula.py`, which is empty. There are no existing documentation or convention files (such as README.md or prior copilot-instructions) to merge or reference.

## Project Overview
- **Single-file Python project**: All code is (or will be) in `python_aula.py`.
- **No external dependencies**: There are no requirements or dependency files present.
- **No build or test scripts**: No automation or workflow files are present.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Place all new code in `python_aula.py` unless otherwise instructed.
- Use standard Python 3 syntax and conventions.
- If you introduce dependencies, document them in a `requirements.txt` file and update these instructions.
- If you add tests, place them in a new file named `test_python_aula.py` in the same directory, and update these instructions.
- If you add documentation, create a `README.md` at the project root and update these instructions.

## Example Patterns
- For scripts: include a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block for entry points.
- For functions/classes: define them at the top level of `python_aula.py`.

## Next Steps
- Update this file as the project grows to reflect new workflows, dependencies, or conventions.
